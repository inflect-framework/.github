### Inflect is an open-source stream processing framework for Kafka that simplifies stateless event transformations between microservices in an event-driven architecture
It is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, providing high performance and throughput without the complexity of large, general-purpose stream processing frameworks. Inflect integrates seamlessly with Kafka and can either complement existing stream processors or serve as a standalone solution, simplifying the management of data flows as complex event-driven architectures evolve over time.
