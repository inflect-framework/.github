### Inflect is a stream processing framework for transforming and routing messages between microservices in an event-driven architecture
It is designed to be lightweight and stateless, providing high performance and throughput without the overhead of large general-purpose stream processing frameworks. Inflect allows developers to easily author and update message transformation pipelines while maintaining consistent schema versioning and evolution. It integrates seamlessly with Kafka and can be used either alongside existing stream processors or as a standalone solution, simplifying the management of data flows and ensuring compatibility and consistency as complex event-driven architectures evolve over time.
